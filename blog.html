          1. Discussion of the scope of var, let and const in JavaScript:
        </h1>

        <p class="mb-6">
          <span class="font-semibold">var</span>,
          <span class="font-semibold">let</span>, and
          <span class="font-semibold">const</span> are all keywords used for
          variable declaration in JavaScript, but they have different scopes and
          behaviors.
        </p>

        <ol class="list-decimal list-inside">
          <li>
            <span class="font-bold">var:</span>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-12">
              <li>
                Variables declared with
                <span class="font-semibold">var</span> are function-scoped. This
                means they are accessible throughout the function in which they
                are declared, regardless of block scope.
              </li>
              <li>
                If declared outside of any function,
                <span class="font-semibold">var</span> variables become global
                variables, accessible throughout the entire program.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="font-semibold">var</span> variables can be
                re-declared and updated.
              </li>
              <li>
                Hoisting: Variables declared with
                <span class="font-semibold">var</span> are hoisted to the top of
                their function or global scope, meaning they are processed
                before the code execution.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="font-bold">let:</span>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-12">
              <li>
                Introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015),
                <span class="font-semibold">let</span> allows block-scoped
                variables.
              </li>
              <li>
                Variables declared with
                <span class="font-semibold">let</span> are only accessible
                within the block they are declared in (like loops or
                conditionals).
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="font-semibold">let</span> variables can be updated
                but not re-declared within the same block scope.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="font-semibold">let</span> variables are also
                hoisted, but unlike <span class="font-semibold">var</span>, they
                are not initialized until their declaration is evaluated.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="font-bold">const:</span>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-12">
              <li>
                Also introduced in ES6,
                <span class="font-semibold">const</span> creates variables whose
                value cannot be changed once set (constant).
              </li>
              <li>
                Like <span class="font-semibold">let</span>,
                <span class="font-semibold">const</span> is block-scoped.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="font-semibold">const</span> variables must be
                initialized at the time of declaration and cannot be re-declared
                or reassigned.
              </li>
              <li>
                While the variable itself is immutable, if it holds an object or
                array, properties of that object or elements of that array can
                still be modified.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p class="my-4">Here's a summary of their scopes:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-12 mb-4">
          <li>
            <span class="font-semibold">var:</span> Function-scoped or globally
            scoped.
          </li>
          <li><span class="font-semibold">let:</span> Block-scoped.</li>
          <li><span class="font-semibold">const:</span> Block-scoped.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-justify">
          In modern JavaScript development, it's generally recommended to use
          <span class="font-semibold">const</span> by default, resorting to
          <span class="font-semibold">let</span> when you know the variable will
          be reassigned. <span class="font-semibold">var</span> is rarely used
          in modern code due to its unpredictable behavior with hoisting and
          scoping.

          2. The use cases of null and undefined:

        <p class="mb-6">
          <span class="font-semibold">null</span> and
          <span class="font-semibold">undefined</span> are both primitive values
          in JavaScript, but they are used in different contexts.
        </p>

        <p class="font-bold mb-5">Use cases for null:</p>

        <ol class="list-decimal list-outside text-justify">
          <li>
            <span class="font-bold">Explicit absence of value:</span>
            <span class="font-semibold"> null</span> is often used to represent
            the intentional absence of any object value. For example, if a
            function expects an object as an argument but no object is
            available, it may return <span class="font-semibold">null</span> to
            indicate the absence of a meaningful value.
          </li>

          <li>
            <span class="font-bold">Clearing object references:</span> Sometimes
            <span class="font-semibold">null</span> is assigned to object
            variables to clear their value and release memory, especially in
            manual memory management scenarios.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p class="font-bold my-5">Use cases for undefined:</p>

        <ol class="list-decimal list-outside text-justify">
          <li>
            <span class="font-bold"
              >Variables that have not been assigned a value:</span
            >
            In JavaScript, if a variable is declared but not assigned any value,
            its default value is <span class="font-semibold"> undefined</span>.
          </li>

          <li>
            <span class="font-bold">Functions with no return value: </span> If a
            function does not explicitly return a value, it implicitly returns
            <span class="font-semibold"> undefined</span>.
          </li>

          <li>
            <span class="font-bold"
              >Properties that do not exist in an object:</span
            >
            Accessing properties that do not exist in an object returns
            <span class="font-semibold"> undefined</span>.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p class="mt-5 text-justify">
          In summary, <span class="font-semibold"> null</span> is used to
          explicitly represent the absence of a value, while
          <span class="font-semibold"> undefined</span> typically indicates an
          uninitialized variable or a missing property.

      <!-- question 3 -->
      <div class="my-10">
        <h1 class="font-bold text-3xl my-4">3. REST API:</h1>
        <p class="mb-6 text-justify">
          REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for
          designing networked applications. A RESTful API (REST API) is an
          application programming interface (API) that follows the principles of
          REST. RESTful APIs are designed to be simple, lightweight, and
          scalable, making them ideal for use over the internet.
        </p>

        <p class="my-5">Key principles of REST APIs include:</p>

        <ol class="list-decimal list-outside text-justify">
          <li>
            <span class="font-bold">Resource-Based: </span>REST APIs are
            centered around resources, which are identified by URIs (Uniform
            Resource Identifiers). Resources can be any entity, such as a user,
            a product, or an order.
          </li>

          <li>
            <span class="font-bold">Uniform Interface: </span>REST APIs have a
            uniform interface, meaning that the same HTTP methods (GET, POST,
            PUT, DELETE) are used for interacting with resources. Additionally,
            resources are manipulated using standard representations, such as
            JSON or XML.
          </li>

          <li>
            <span class="font-bold">Stateless: </span>REST APIs are stateless,
            meaning that each request from a client to the server must contain
            all the information necessary to understand and fulfill the request.
            The server does not store any client state between requests.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="font-bold">Client-Server Architecture: </span>REST APIs
            follow a client-server architecture, where the client and server are
            separate and communicate over a stateless protocol (usually HTTP).
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="font-bold">Cacheability: </span>Responses from a
            RESTful API can be cached to improve performance. Cacheability is
            controlled through HTTP cache headers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="font-bold">Layered System: </span>REST APIs are often
            built using a layered system architecture, where each layer has a
            specific role and communicates only with adjacent layers.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p class="mt-5 text-justify">
          RESTful APIs are commonly used for building web services that allow
          different systems to communicate with each other over the internet.
          They are widely used in web development for implementing backend
          services that provide data to frontend applications, mobile apps, and
          other systems.
